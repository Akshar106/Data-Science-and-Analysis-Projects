General Population Trends:

	1. What is the overall trend in global population over the years?
	2. Which countries have experienced the most significant population growth or decline?
	3. Urban vs. Rural Population:

	How has the balance between urban and rural populations changed over time?
	Are there countries where urban population growth is outpacing rural population growth, and vice versa?
Population Density:

	Which countries have the highest and lowest population densities, and how has this changed over time?
	Are there regions with high population density but low urbanization?

Life Expectancy:

	What is the average life expectancy across different countries and years?
	How does life expectancy correlate with urbanization and access to healthcare?

Birth and Death Rates:

	Which countries have the highest birth rates, and how have these rates changed?
	Are there countries with consistently high death rates, and what factors contribute to this?

Fertility Rate:

	How does the fertility rate vary by country and region?
