## 1 - Bank Churn Analysis : 
Bank Churn Analysis refers to the process of examining and predicting customer churn in the banking industry. Churn, in this context, refers to the phenomenon where customers terminate their relationship with a bank and switch to a competitor or completely cease their banking activities. Bank churn analysis aims to understand the factors that contribute to customer attrition and develop strategies to retain customers and minimize churn.

The analysis involves gathering and analyzing data from various sources within the bank, such as customer demographics, transaction history, account details, customer service interactions, and customer feedback. By analyzing this data, patterns and trends can be identified to determine the key indicators that influence customer churn.
